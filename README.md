# STM_Lab18_AudioSystemDemo
 Demo of Basic Audio System on STM32F769I DISCO

This is a project for the STM32f769i-Disco development board.

Cube IDE v1.31.1

It runs up the audio CODEC, sets up the LCD and touch screen and also uses some basic GPIO checks for buttons.

Compiler pre-processor settings are -

DEBUG

USE_STM32F769I_DISCO_REVB03

USE_HAL_DRIVER
